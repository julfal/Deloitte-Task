Too whom it may concern,

Kindly find the github repository used to complete this task

https://github.com/julfal/Deloitte-Task

Furthermore,

Kindly note that html, css and mostly Javascript was used with the added functionaly of node js
and Sqlite3.

To test the work kindly note that you need to edit the details.env file to add your email and
password (NB: For your password kindly create an app password like I did and enable 2fa).

On the repository these details will be empty.

If you have questions or queries on how I designed and implemented the system do not hesitate
to contact me.
